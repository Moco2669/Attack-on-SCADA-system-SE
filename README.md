# SCADA System Simulation and Security Analysis

## üìò **Overview**
This project simulates a **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system** for a **nuclear power plant**. The simulation models the communication between the **SCADA HMI (Human-Machine Interface)** and the plant's control systems using the **Modbus protocol**.  
The primary goal is to **analyze and address security vulnerabilities** by simulating various types of cyberattacks on the system.
